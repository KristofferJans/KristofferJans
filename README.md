# About me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **@KristofferJans**
  
  - I studied HR Management and then switched to IT because I was always fascinated by this area. I then worked as a Junior IT Consultant in the field of communication,       processes and organizational development and was able to gain my first experience in an IT environment. Now I would like to expand my tech stack with the Web Development Boot Camp.
    
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **Technolgy**.
  
  - New technology has always fascinated me. My favorite thing at the moment is discovering new AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude etc. and testing the limits of what is possible.
    
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **WebDev @spiced**.
